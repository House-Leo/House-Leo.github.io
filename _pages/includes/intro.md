I have got my B.E. degree from [Guangdong University of Technology (GDUT)](https://gdut.edu.cn). Currently I am a third-year master candidate in the School of Information Engineering, GDUT, advised by [Prof. Zhijing Yang](https://yzw.gdut.edu.cn/info/1118/2031.htm) and [Dr. Yukai Shi](https://ykshi.github.io). I also collaborate with [Prof. Jinshan Pan](https://jspan.github.io) from [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://njust.edu.cn) closely. 

Research interest: image restoration (e.g. denoising/super-resolution), out-of-distribution, semi-supervised learning. 

I will join **[IMAG](https://imag-njust.net/)** in September 2022, advised by [Prof. Jinshan Pan](https://jspan.github.io/).
