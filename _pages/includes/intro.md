I am currently a first-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [IMAG](https://imag-njust.net/), Nanjing University of Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Jinshan Pan](https://jspan.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.E. and M.S. degree from School of Information Engineering, [Guangdong University of Technology (GDUT)](https://gdut.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Zhijing Yang](https://yzw.gdut.edu.cn/info/1118/2031.htm). I also collaborate with [Dr. Yukai Shi](https://ykshi.github.io) from [GDUT](https://gdut.edu.cn) and [Xiang Chen](https://cxtalk.github.io) from [IMAG](https://imag-njust.net/) closely.

Research interest: image restoration (e.g. denoising/super-resolution), out-of-distribution, semi-supervised learning.
